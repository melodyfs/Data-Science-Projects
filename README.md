# Data Science Projects
A curated list of end-to-end data science projects I built.

## Data Analysis & Visualizations
- Make School Summer Academy NPS dataset
  - Make School Summer Academy (SA) is a 8-week program that teaches iOS development. This project investigated SA Net Promoter Score (NPS) data to find interesting and actionable trends that inform decision-makers about students' satisfaction towards the program and the likelihood that students would recommend SA to others.

    - [Slides](https://github.com/melodyfs/DS-1-Data-Analysis/blob/master/SA_survey_project.pdf): summary + key findings
- YouTube dataset for trending videos
  - This project cleaned and analyzed the dataset to understand key elements contributing to the virality of videos on YouTube with data visualization & analysis.
    - [Notebook](https://github.com/melodyfs/YouTube-Video-Analysis/blob/master/YouTube_US_Analysis.ipynb): documents the process + source code

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- [Recogmize](http://bit.ly/recogmize) (on the App Store)
  - A showcase of image classifiers and OCRs (optical character recognizers) I built. From training models to putting models into the iOS app. This project combined my skills in iOS development with data science.
    - One of the OCRs was used by [Nukon](http://bit.ly/nukon-app)
    - [Dedicated repository](https://github.com/melodyfs/Recogmize): contains the source code
    - Relevant article: [How I built a handwriting recognizer and shipped it to the App Store](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/build-a-handwriting-recognizer-ship-it-to-app-store-fcce24205b4b)
- Diabetes 130 Hospitals Records
  - This project cleaned the data and built a model that predicts which patients would be readmitted
